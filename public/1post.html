                    <p>People often asked me why I decided to become a software engineers and I would say I like to program and write codes. However, that wasn’t the case the very first time I started writing javascript codes. In truth, I hated programming after I took my very first computer science course in sophomore year of college, which is Java. One of the biggest reasons as to why I disliked programming the first time was because my instructor didn’t show any interest or any motivation in his teaching. I cannot exactly blame him for his of lack of enthusiasm since he was only a grad student and it was probably his first time teaching. However, I didn’t completely lose interest in computer science but I definitely didn’t look at programming for quite a while.</p>
                    <p>  It wasn’t until toward my second semester of my senior year that I decided to take a look at programming again. One big reason as to why I decided to go back to programming was my brother-in-law, he told me the endless possibilities that I can create on the web and the ability to share it with millions of people across the globe. Just the thought of my website can be shared across the web or my mobile app in an app store got me really excited in the idea of programming. From that point on, the domino effect started and it led me to eventually apply for an programming school after I graduated from college.</p>
                    <p>  Applying to MakerSquare was one of the best decisions I’ve made and it truly reinforced my decision to become a software engineer. My journey began when I started the Makersqaure application process. One of the most important things I learned to becoming a good developer is that you need to be constantly practicing you javascript fundamentals. Just like any sports, if you do not practice and hone your skills it would only deteriorates your javascript knowledge. Thus, for my preparation, I did as many problems as I could at coderbyte.com to improve my javascript skills. In addition, I read up on all the recommended chapters on eloquent javascript to truly get a full grasp on my fundamentals. Lastly, the one preparation that really helped me at Makersquare was going through the underscore library. Re-writing the Underscore library further reinforced my understanding of javascript skills and helped me acquired the skill to learn. Learning to learn is one of the most valuable skills to have because in the web industry, everything is constantly changing, in order to be on top of everything, you need to be able to learn anything at anytime.</p>
